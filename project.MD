To set up a robust admin route, follow these steps:

1. Create a dedicated route for admin functionality.
2. Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access the admin route.
3. Use middleware to handle common admin-related tasks, such as logging, error handling, and input validation.
4. Organize your admin route into logical sub-routes for different admin functionalities, such as user management, content management, and settings.
5. Implement appropriate access controls and permissions for each admin functionality to restrict actions based on user roles.
6. Ensure proper error handling and informative error messages to provide a smooth user experience.
7. Regularly review and update your admin route to address any security vulnerabilities or performance issues.

Remember to thoroughly test your admin route to ensure its robustness and reliability.
